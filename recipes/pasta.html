    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>White sauce pasta is a creamy and comforting dish made by tossing cooked pasta in a rich b√©chamel sauce, which is made from butter, flour, and milk. The sauce is often seasoned with salt, black pepper, garlic, and sometimes herbs like oregano or basil for added flavor. Grated cheese, typically Parmesan or mozzarella, is often mixed in to enhance the creaminess and taste. Vegetables like mushrooms, bell peppers, or broccoli can be added for texture and nutrition, and it can also be paired with proteins like chicken or shrimp. White sauce pasta is loved for its smooth, cheesy taste and satisfying, indulgent feel.</p>
